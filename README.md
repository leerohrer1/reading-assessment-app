# ReadingAssessmentApp

## An App for Reading Teachers
In order to progress students' reading skills, teachers meet with students on a frequent (sometimes daily) basis to assess students' progress. This web app allows teachers to use a popular reading framework (The Continuum of Literacy Learning Grades K-8 by Fountas and Pinnell) to keep track of the specific behaviors students are exhibiting as they learn. 

### Currently For Kindergaten Only
The Continuum of Literacy Learning goes all the way to eigth grade; however, the reading assessment checklists on this app are only available for Reading Levels A through E, which shakes out to be a little beyond where an average Kindergarten student should be by the end of their Kindergarten school year.
